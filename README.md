# THE UNOFFICIAL SYSTEM SHOCK 1 SPECIFICATIONS

This is a sub-project as part of the [InkyBlackness](https://inkyblackness.github.io) project. It aims to document the data (resource) files of the video game [System Shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock). It is the continuation of the previous work performed as part of "The System Shock Hack Project" ([TSSHP](http://tsshp.sourceforge.net/)).

The goal is to document all meaningful bits and bytes of the original data files.

Start reading with the [main page](index.md) (the index).

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, please consider [the guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Status
The content of this documentation supersedes the information available from TSSHP (the [ss-specs.txt](http://tsshp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tsshp/tsshp/doc/ss-specs.txt?view=markup) file). In some instances, this documentation even provides more accurate descriptions.

The format of all raw media content is described, with the exception of a few unknown fields. The same counts for the game objects.
See the [issue list](https://github.com/inkyblackness/ss-specs/issues) for an overview about what is still actively analyzed.
With the release of the original source (see credits below), many so far unknown things can be clarified.

Currently not in scope of this documentation project are music files (See [here for details](other/Music.md)) and the Macintosh release.


## Credits
* This project, as well as InkyBlackness itself, wouldn't be possible without the work of TSSHP and the effort of the people before that.
* [Source release](https://github.com/NightDiveStudios/shockmac) of the Mac version, which finally allowed to figure out unknown details, and set some guesswork naming right.
