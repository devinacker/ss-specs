# THE UNOFFICIAL SYSTEM SHOCK 1 SPECIFICATIONS

This is a sub-project as part of the [InkyBlackness](https://inkyblackness.github.io) project. It aims to document the data (resource) files of the video game [System Shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock). It is the continuation of the previous work performed as part of "The System Shock Hack Project" ([TSSHP](http://tsshp.sourceforge.net/)).

The goal is to document all meaningful bits and bytes of the original data files.

Start reading with the [main page](index.md) (the index).

## Status
In its current state, this project does **not** supersede the information available from TSSHP (the [ss-specs.txt](http://tsshp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tsshp/tsshp/doc/ss-specs.txt?view=markup) file). Content will be gradually ported to this project if a corresponding implementation exists within InkyBlackness.

## Credits
This project, as well as InkyBlackness itself, wouldn't be possible without the work of TSSHP and the effort of the people before that.
